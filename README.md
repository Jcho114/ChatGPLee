# ChatGPLee
A GPT 3.5 based Discord bot meant to respond to users with messages resembling those of the notorious Discord user mashyy and (to an extent) his imposter rnashy. The bot is powered by a fine-tuning of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model based on a given dataset. The bot includes the ability to respond to pings, collect Discord message data of a user (admin command), and take screenshots of previous messages. The bot, at the moment, has some weird issues to fix (responding and mentioning its own prompt, repeating the user's message back to them) but it is quite comedic.
